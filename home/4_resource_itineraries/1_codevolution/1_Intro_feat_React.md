# 1. Intro feat. React
Created Thursday 11 August 2022

I know most of this from the Redux I learnt in the [React: The Complete Guide](https://github.com/sanjar-notes/reactjs-notes) course.
Anyway, for the sake of remembering:
1. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
2. Redux is independent of the UI library/framework being used, and works for vanilla JS too.
3. RTK (Redux Toolkit) is a library built on top of Redux that makes working with Redux easier. It is also made by the same creator as Redux.
4. React-Redux is the official React bindings library by the Redux creator. It helps in minimizing boilerplate code and makes using Redux in React apps easier.
   
Stuff the course will be teaching (in order):
1. Redux - core, from the basics.
2. React Toolkit - independent of React
3. React Redux
