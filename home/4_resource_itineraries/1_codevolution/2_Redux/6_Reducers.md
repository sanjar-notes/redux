# 6. Reducer
Created Thursday 11 August 2022

- A function containing how the state changes based on an emitted action.
- The reducer should return a updated state, but should not mutate the existing state directly.

Note: in the Redux library, the reducer is called automatically when the app starts. This should be used to set the initial state of the store, using a default parameter. Example:
```js
const initialState = { count: 0};

function myReducer(state = initialState, action) {
	switch(action.type) { // initially this is some cryptic string generated by Redux, and will not match any of the user defined action types. Hence, the default case is run
		...
		default: return state;
	}
}
```
